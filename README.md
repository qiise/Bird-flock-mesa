to start:

pip install matplotlib
pip install mesa
pip install numpy

(I believe these are all the libraries you need, and install Python if you have not already done so)

mesa version: 1.2.0 (newer version doesn't recognize mesa.time)


to run: 

python flocking_model.py


this should cause a matplotlib window to open on your computer with the simulation running
